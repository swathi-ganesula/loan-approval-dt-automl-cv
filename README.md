Loan Approval Prediction using Decision Tree and AutoML
Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting loan approval status using machine learning techniques on a structured loan dataset. The implementation combines a Decision Tree model with automated model optimization methods to improve prediction performance and evaluation reliability.

Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to build a classification system that determines whether a loan application should be approved based on applicant demographic and financial information.

Dataset

The project uses a loan dataset containing features such as applicant income, education, loan amount, credit history, and other related attributes that influence loan approval decisions.

Methodology

The following steps were performed during model development:

Loaded and explored the loan dataset
